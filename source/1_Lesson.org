- In this project you're going to make an electronic door buzzer, like the one shown below.
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- To activate the buzzer and the LED, we're going to use a circuit component called a transistor.
- In this lesson you'll learn what a transistor is and how it can be used as an electronic switch

- Transistors come in many shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:

- All transistors have three legs - a collector, a base and an emitter.
- The type of transistor you're going to be using is a BC547B, which looks like this.

- Use online resources to help you label the picture above, to show which legs are which.
** Try It

:END:
- The circuit symbol for a transistor looks like this.
[[file:http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/BJT_symbol_NPN.svg/200px-BJT_symbol_NPN.svg.png]]
- The legs have been labelled B,C and E.
- Now look at the simulation below. This shows a transistor connected to a 5V Power supply, with an LED.
[[file:img/transistor.gif]]
- Connected to the =base= of the transistor is a signal generator.
- The signal generator produces a varying voltage, going from 0 up to 5V and then back down again.
- The voltmeter will tell you the voltage being produced by the signal generator.
** Badge It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Copy an image of the BC547B transistor and label each pin.
- In the circuit above, try and explain what is causing the LED to switch on and off again.
- Make sure your are using the following terms:
  1. Base
  2. Collector
  3. Emitter
  4. Signal Generator
  5. LED
  6. Current
  7. Voltage

- Your badge will be awarded by the quality of your explanation to the circuit above.
- The silver badge must include the diagram.

- *Silver* - A *reasonable* attempt at an explanation of the circuit *plus* labelled image of BC547B
- *Gold* - A *correct* explanation that uses the term base, collector and emitter.
- *Platinum* - A *detailed* explanation using all the terms from the badge task
