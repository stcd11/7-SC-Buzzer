- Plastics are a class of material that are usually synthesised from fossil fuels like oil or natural gas.
- Plastics are made up of molecules called polymers.
- Polymers are very long chains of atoms

- Plastics are so named, because they can deform (stretch, squash, bend) without breaking.

- There are many different types of plastic.
- Use online resources to list some of the uses of the following plastics
  - Polyester
  - Polyvinyl chloride
  - Polyethylene

- There are two main classes of plastic:
  - Thermoplastics
  - Thermosetting polymers.
- When we heat a thermoplastic, it softens and becomes malleable. This allows us to alter it's shape, which will remain after we cool it down.
- When we heat a thermosetting polymer, it does not soften and so can not be shaped.

- Explain, with diagrams, what are the differences between thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers.
- *Silver* - A reasonable attempt at describing the difference between the types of plastics.
- *Gold* - A good explanation, with 3 examples of each.
- *Platinum* - An excellent explanation of the different uses of several types of plastics.
