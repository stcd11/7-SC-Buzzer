- Gather the following components.
  - A 9 or 5V Buzzer
  - A BC547B Transistor
  - A 330Ω resistor
  - A 1kΩ resistor
  - and your board.
[[file:img/IMG_1463.JPG]]
- Solder these components directly to your board as shown below (ensure you get the transistor and the buzzer the right way around)

- Now we need to solder on the LED.
- To allow the LED to be mounted in the case, we're going to solder it onto flying leads.
- Firstly, cut around 10cm of red and black =multicore= wire and strip the ends. Also find an 5mm LED in the colour you desire.
[[file:img/IMG_1470.JPG]]
- Now apply a little bit of solder to the long leg of the LED.
[[file:img/IMG_1471.JPG]]
- Then apply a little solder to the stripped end of the red wire.
- Now you can hold the two together, and use your soldering iron to apply a little heat. The solder will melt and bond the two together.
[[file:img/IMG_1472.JPG]]
- Now slide some heatshrink up the wire so that it covers the solder join. Use the edge of your iron to heat the heatshrink.
[[file:img/IMG_1473.JPG]]
- Repeat this with the short leg and the black wire, then twist the wires together.
[[file:img/IMG_1474.JPG]]
- You can now solder the flying leads into the board.

- We need to do the same with the push-to-make switch
- Twist red and black multicore wire through the holes in the legs of the switch.
[[file:img/IMG_1475.JPG]]
- Then add solder and heatshrink to secure the leads in place.
[[file:img/IMG_1476.JPG]]
- Then solder the leads to the board.

- Lastly you need to solder your battery snap in place.
- Feed the leads of your battery snap through the strain hole and then down into the solder holes as shown.
[[file:img/IMG_1478.JPG]]
[[file:img/IMG_1479.JPG]]
- Then solder them in place.
